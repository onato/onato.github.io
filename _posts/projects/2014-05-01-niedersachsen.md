I developed this bike navigation app for Toursprung who were taked with creating a routing app that worked well for tourists. The algorythim is weighted by the data extracted from Bikemap and OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap data identifies touristically significant roads and Bikemap identifies roads that bike riders actuall ride on. The goal of the project is to provide a simple interface to get you and your bike to the spots most worth seeing. Text to speech is provided by the AVSpeechSynthesizer.

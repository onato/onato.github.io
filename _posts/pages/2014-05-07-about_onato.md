## App Development
I have extensive experience in the IT industry, spanning many years. Specifically, I have dedicated 14 years to native iOS app development, working with various technologies ranging from pre-ARC Objective-C to modern SwiftUI and SwiftData. In recent years, starting from 2022, I have also ventured into Rust programming to effectively offload business logic to a binary that can be shared across iOS and Android applications.

## What else?
I have experience working with a wide range of technologies, including microcontrollers, Bluetooth LE devices, server infrastructures, and CNC production facilities. While I specialize in Apple platforms development, I am always eager to explore new areas. Lately, I have been delving into machine learning, further expanding my skill set.

## Me
In the 90s, I developed call center and customer relationship management applications for large multinational clients. At the turn of the century, I worked in the fast-paced environment of the dot com bubble. Following the crash, I pursued my interest in design and gained further expertise in web development and media art. In 2005, I founded Fluid Forms, a design studio specializing in online distribution of mass-customized products. Since 2010, I have been fully dedicated to developing mobile applications.

## Continued Education
Reading is something I truly enjoy, and I have a passion for expanding my knowledge beyond the realm of software engineering. I have extensively explored various subjects such as QA, UX Design, Management, and Machine Learning through reading numerous standard works in these fields. While I don't strive to be a master of all trades, I firmly believe that having a well-rounded education in adjacent disciplines greatly enhances communication skills and fosters a deep appreciation for talented collaborators.

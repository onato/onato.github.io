"What do I look like to my computer"? My first response to this question was a time-laps video of my working day through the perspective of my computers webcam. I then looked at how it would create its own representation of me staring at it. 

The result is a script that starts with a flat mesh. It then moves each vertex in a random 
manner and compares the rendered mesh with an image of my face. It repeats 
this process over and over trying to get closer to the image it has of me. I use a fitness 
algorithm which influences how much the vertices move, depending on the how close the surounding part of the image is to the source image.

The geometry it creates is quite different to my face, but when rendered on the 
screen it is a fare approximation. It reflects the fact that a computer model of 
someone is build quickly but does not necessarily represent reality.

  <h1>Stephen Williams - Senior Software Engineer</h1>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>I've worked mostly on iOS/iPadOS apps, but I also write Android apps, Golang Lambdas for Analytics, Ruby on Rails apps with React frontends, BigQuery data transformations, and all manner of things that need to be done.</p>
    <p>Having studied computer science and design, and read the canonical literature of the software engineering field as well as adjacent fields, I'm well placed to help put all the pieces in place for a successful project.</p>
    <p>My work is used by the the big tech companies as well as the Department of Conservation in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>I enjoy tackling complex projects, even with vague requirements, and successfully bringing them to fruition.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me for further discussion.</p>

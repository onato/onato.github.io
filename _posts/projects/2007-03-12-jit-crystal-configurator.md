The “Just in Time” renderer is designed to configure color without losing photo-realistic rendering quality. It was developed for a crystal manufacturer to generate images for their catalogs instead of having to photograph many similar products.

The high-quality aspects of the rendering are prerendered in many layers. The layers are then combined at the last minute with the color and other effects to produce the final image.

##Web Development
Most apps require a web application to communicate with. I can lend my 12 years of web development experience to the development of scalable, stable and fast server applications. I have developed server applications with J2E, Spring, Grails, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Node.js and this side is developed with Jekyl. I can also help out your marketing team with experience with analytics and online advertising.

##Me
In the 90's I developed call center applications and customer relationship management applications for large multinational clients. At the turn of the century I worked in the craziness of the dot com bubble. After the crash I studied design whilst working in the web development and media art branches. In 2005 I founded Fluid Forms, a design studio with online distribution of mass customised products. In 2010 I began developing mobile applications full time.

##My Partners
When skills are required that exceed my own, I have a network of talented partners to get the job done. Be it graphic design, film making, usability testing, copywriting, system administration and more, I can help build a team meet your needs.

I seldom work on projects alone. I usually work with a web developer, I often work with designers.

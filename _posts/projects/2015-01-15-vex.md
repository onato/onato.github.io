VEX is an iOS, Android, HTML/Javascript and Node.js  application for performing remote insurance appraisals. Users can video chat with the appraiser so that appraisals can be quickly and effectively performed from the office. Video sessions are archived for possible liability disputes. Hi resolution photos can be taken by the appraiser at any time to ensure all details are captured.

The VEX application has its own Node.js backend which provides web-services for easy integration to legacy systems.

For this project I partnered with [Stefan Zedlacher](http://www.zedlacher.org/) who also worked on the backend and handled the integration with the clients existing document management system.

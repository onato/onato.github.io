## App Development
I have donkey's years of experience in the IT industry and 14 years of native iOS app development. I worked with everything from the pre-ARC Objective-C days to modern SwiftUI and SwiftData. Since 2022, I have been working in Rust to offload business logic to a binary shared across iOS and Android apps.

## What else?
I have worked with everything from microcontrollers and Bluetooth LE devices to complex server infrastructures and CNC production facilities. Whilst I am an expert in Apple platforms development, I am a profoundly curious person. Recently, I have been cutting my teeth on machine learning.

## Me
In the 90s, I developed call center and customer relationship management applications for large multinational clients. At the turn of the century, I worked in the craziness of the dot com bubble. After the crash, I studied design whilst working in the web development and media art branches. In 2005, I founded Fluid Forms, a design studio with online distribution of mass-customized products. In 2010, I began developing mobile applications full-time.

## Continued Education
Reading is something I really enjoy, and I don't limit myself to the canon of computer science. I have read many of the standard works in the fields of QA, UX Design, Management, and Machine Learning. I don't aim to be a jack of all trades, but having an education in adjacent fields aids greatly in communication and especially in the appreciation of talented colleagues.

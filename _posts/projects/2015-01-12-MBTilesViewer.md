<span itemprop="description">MBTilesView is a viewer that helps you examine the contents of your MBTiles files. It shows you the files included metadata and which tiles are included at each zoom level.<br/><br/>
For a couple of buck you can see all the info you need at the click of a button. Stop reading your mbtiles files like an SQLite file and see what the file really represents.</span>

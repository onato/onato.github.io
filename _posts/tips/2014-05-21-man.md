###Find the Linux Command You Nead

Copied from [From Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13131935/215748)

If you can sum up what you're trying to achieve in one word, there's a mighty fine help feature on Linux.

    man -k <your search term>
    
What that does is to list all commands that have your search term in the short description. There's usually a pretty good chance that you will find what you're after. ;)

That output can sometimes be somewhat overwhelming, and I'd recommend narrowing it down to the executables, rather than all available man-pages, like so:

    man -k find | egrep '\(1\)'

or, if you also want to look for commands that require higher privilege levels, like this:

    man -k find | egrep '\([18]\)'

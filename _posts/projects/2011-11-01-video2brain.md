The iPad App for video2brain enabled customers to comfortably view courses on- or offline and save their favorite courses and videos for later viewing in the app or on an apple-tv using air-play. I created the video2brain App whilst working for the agency [Parkside Interactive](https://www.parkside-interactive.com/). 

Video2brain was bought by Lynda which was in turn bought by LinkedIn and rebranded as [LinkedIn Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn_Learning).

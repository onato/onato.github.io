<p>We all tend to want to think big, but often the small things, iterated over and over, are the most powerful and sustainable means of change.</p>

<p>By understanding how ant colonies self organize, with very little logic on the side of the individual ants, I tried to gain insight the principle of emergence.</p>
</div>

<p>
Thousands of ant start of randomly searching for food. Two simple rules provide a feedback loop that appears to give them some kind of intelegence. The ants leaving the nest searching for food leave a pheromone which indicates this. Lets call this Pheromone-Home. Once an ant finds food, which is depicted green, it starts following the trails of Pheromone-Home to find its way home. Whilst doing so it leaves Pheromone-Food behind it. The ants looking for food can then start following Pheromon-Food to find food faster. The feedback loop is complete. As time goes on the ant stumble upon short cuts. These are comunicated by the higher traffic, and therefor stronger pheromones, on paths that find more food.

For VEX, I created an iOS and Android app with a Web app and a Node.js server for performing remote insurance appraisals. Users can video chat with the appraiser so that appraisals can be quickly and effectively performed from the office. Video sessions are archived for possible liability disputes. High-resolution photos can be taken by the appraiser at any time to ensure all details are captured.

The VEX application has its own Node.js backend that provides web services for easy integration into legacy systems.

The Cassius boxing bag is a tactile interface for sculpting a lampshade. Sixty three sensors record the location and force of your punches and deform a virtual lampshade at the corresponding location.

After sculpting your ideal form it is then 3D-Printed using selective laser sintering.

Controller: Arduino
Lamp Visualisation: OpenFrameworks

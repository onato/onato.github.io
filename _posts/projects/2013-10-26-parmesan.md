Last year in Regnano, Reggio Emilia, Italy I got the chance to see how Enrico "The King of Cheese" makes Parmesan (Parmigiano-Reggiano). 

It is not everyday one gets inside a cheese factory where some of the best cheese in the worked is made. To give you a peak too, I snapped the Cannon 5D and filmed hand held with existing light. Editing was done quick and dirty with iMovie.

###Technical Details
Technology: iMovie, Film, Canon 5D
